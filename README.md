Timeless and Classics has reached a new level...

Reforged

Yes Timeless and Classics is branching away from being an Add-on from CGM, we will start with using CGM as our base source code, and slowly but surely refactor as much as possible to meet more realistic standards and functions, better or even requiring much of Mr.Crayfish's original code to be changed, in order to keep the mod clean and reliable in every metric!

Thank you Mr.Crayfish for the creation and openess of CGM, and the Team, I, and millions of others say thank you for your work, we wish to keep your legacy going beyond imagination! Thank you!

Please be sure to take a look at the Original CGM mod, the true creator of TaC! (https://github.com/MrCrayfish/MrCrayfishGunMod)
